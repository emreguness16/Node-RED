# Node-RED
This project aims to develop an LED interaction application using Arduino UNO through the web-based Node-RED platform. The project allows the LEDs to be turned on and off through a functional web interface and can also be interactively controlled.

Node-RED has a block-based interface that can be easily understood even by users with no programming knowledge. Therefore, this project is intended for those who want to improve their programming skills but have limited experience. You can examine the source code of this project on GitHub and use it in your own projects.

I look forward to your participation in this project!
